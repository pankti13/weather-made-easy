# Weather Made Easy☀️
## Project Description✨
This repository hosts a weather forecast application developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The application leverages real-time data to provide users with accurate weather information, including the current geographical location, current temperature with wind and humidity details, as well as the maximum and minimum temperatures for the day. Additionally, it offers a five-day forecast, displaying the maximum and minimum temperatures for the upcoming days.

## Features📋
⁘Real-time Data: The application fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeather API, ensuring users receive up-to-date information for their location.<br><br>
⁘Geolocation: The app automatically detects and displays the user's current geographical location if they need to view weather of their current location, eliminating the need for manual input.<br><br>
⁘Search Functionality: Users can search for weather information for any desired city worldwide. If multiple cities with the same name exist, users can enter the country code to obtain more accurate results.<br><br>
⁘Current Weather: Users can view the current temperature, overall description of current weather, wind speed, and humidity.<br><br>
⁘Daily Forecast: The application provides the maximum and minimum temperatures for 5 upcoming days.
